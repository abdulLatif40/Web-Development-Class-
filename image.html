<p>The need to fit in, to be like the most famous and cool person, and to be accepted lovingly is inherited in all of us. But how long do you think you can handle this? For how longdo you think you can suppress and hide your real identity?For how long are you going to be different from differentpeople? You try to be different for everyone around you. Youare different for your partner, different for your boss,different for your friends, and different for your loved ones.And in all of this, THE REAL YOU IS LOST. YOU HAVE LOSTYOUR REAL ESSENCE, YOUR REAL SELF. Imagine Yourself asa computer and see how you have opened different tabs ofyour personality for each person you meet. New person,new tab. Perhaps, that's the reason your real personality hascrashed.It’s not like I am a saint. I have tried hard to changemyself into the most acceptable and loving version as well.In fact, there are times when by default, I try to hide who I
truly am or what I am thinking just to present myself as a  ‘wanted’ person. Why? Why do we have to try so hard to getothers' attention and is it worth losing our real identity?And do you know what’s funny? After losing ourselvescompletely, we fall for those ‘self-love’ hacks. Sometimes, I feel like we are kidding ourselves. I am not a love expert. God forbid. But I know one thing that you fall in with someone when you get to know them. Isn’t it? So, let’s find YOU so that you can fall in love with the real YOU. Shall we? </p>
